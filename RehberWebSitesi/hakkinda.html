        <h3>The beginning of everything</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After growing up in different parts of Turkey, we found ourselves in
            different universities in Turkey, the US, and the UK and corporate
            jobs with organizations like McKinsey and Eczacibasi.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our passion to do more impactful work led us to organizations like
            the World Bank and Malala Fund or help to build organizations like
            LaunchCode in the US.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>We founded Kodluyoruz</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Three of us started working together when, with the help of founder
            friends Aykut and Onur, we co-founded Kodluyoruz in Turkey in 2016
            and pioneered the free coding bootcamp model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kodluyoruz grew to be one of the most impactful education nonprofits
            in Turkey, helped thousands of people get jobs in technology, won
            social impact awards, and taught us a lot about creating pathways
            for tech careers at scale.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2021 the birth of Patika.dev</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aspiring to carry our learnings to a much larger scale globally, we
            founded Patika.dev in 2021 March, in the midst of the pandemic.
          </li>
          <li>
            We started off by partnering with top Turkish employers, such as
            Google and Trendyol, to offer free coding bootcamps with job
            placements at the end.
          </li>
          <li>
            In our first year, we launched more than 50 free coding bootcamps
            and helped almost 1000 people get started with their tech careers.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2022, we started experimenting with various models to expand our
            impact beyond Turkey. By the end of 2022, our e-learning platform
            reached 130,000+ developers from Turkey while 150+ companies
            partnered with us to train and hire talent at scale.
